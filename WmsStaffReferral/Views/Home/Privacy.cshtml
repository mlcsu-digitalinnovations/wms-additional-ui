        <h3>What data do we collect?</h3>

        <p>
          When you access the Staff Site, you are the data subject who supplies the
          information necessary for your use of the system. This includes personal
          data such as your:

          <li>Main Role within the NHS</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In addition, with your consent, NHS Digital Weight Management Programme
          will identify your NHS number and GP practice. This information is for
          service monitoring and evaluation purposes only and we will not access
          your medical record or share such details with your employer or any other
          third party.
        </p>
        <h3>How we use your Personal Data</h3>

        <p>
          We will use your personal data only when the law allows us
          to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the
          following ways:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>To enable you, as a user, to access the Hub and to select your chosen Weight Management Provider.</li>
          <li>To enable your chosen Provider to know basic information about you as a client of their service and to enable them to contact you.</li>
          <li>To enable NHSE/I to contact you, if you so choose, to take part in future evaluations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What  do we do with your information?</h3>

        <p>
          Your information is securely stored in our database. The
          data collected by the system is available to your chosen
          Provider for them to contact you to  commence your
          programme. We will not share your data with any non-related
          third parties. Your data may be sent or stored outside of
          the UK. Nor will we use the information to make any
          automated decisions that might affect you.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the
          internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our
          best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee
          the security of your data transmitted to our App; any
          transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received
          your information, we will use strict procedures and
          security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
        </p>

        <p>
          If NHS Midlands and Lancashire CSU (MLCSU) or its assets are
          acquired by a third party or transferred to a third-party
          personal data held by  it about its registered users will
          be one of the transferred assets.
        </p>

        <p>
          MLCSU will comply with any legal obligation to share personal
          data, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of
          MLCSU, our registered users and customers. This includes
          exchanging information with other companies and organisations
          for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk
          reduction and to aid the prevention of cybercrime.
        </p>

        <p>
          We may use cookies or browser storage to temporarily store
          information on your device. This information will be used
          to secure your login session, remember the application
          state, and to cache data when the device is without an
          Internet connection.
        </p>

        <h3>Data  Retention</h3>

        <p>
          We will only retain your personal data for as long as is
          reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we
          collected it, including satisfying any legal, regulatory,
          accounting or reporting requirements.
        </p>

        <h3>Your rights</h3>

        <p>
          <strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data
          (commonly known as a &quot;data subject access
          request&quot;). This enables you to  receive a copy of the
          personal data we hold about you and to check that we are
          lawfully processing it.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data
          that we hold about you. This enables you to have any
          incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected,
          though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data
          you provide to us.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data.
          This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal
          data where there is no good reason for us continuing to
          process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete
          or remove your personal data where you have successfully
          exercised your right to object to processing (see below),
          where we may have processed your information unlawfully or
          where we are required to erase your personal data to
          comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always
          be able to comply  with your request of erasure for specific
          legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable,
          at the time of your request.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data
          where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of
          a third party) and there is something about your situation
          which makes you want to object to processing on this ground
          as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and
          freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are
          processing your personal data for direct marketing
          purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have
          compelling legitimate grounds to process your information
          which override your rights and freedoms.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Request restriction</strong> of processing of your
          personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the
          processing of your personal data in the following
          scenarios:
        </p>
        <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
          <li>if you want us to establish the data's accuracy</li>
          <li>
            where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not
            want us to erase it
          </li>
          <li>
            where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer
            require it as you need it to establish, exercise or
            defend legal claims
          </li>
          <li>
            you have objected to our use of your data but we need
            to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds
            to use it.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data
          to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a
          third party you have chosen, your personal data in a
          structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note
          that this right only applies to automated information which
          you initially provided consent for us to use or where we
          used the information to perform a contract with you.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Withdraw consent</strong> at any time where we are
          relying on consent to process your personal data. However,
          this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing
          carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you
          withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide
          certain products or services to you. We will advise you if
          this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
        </p>
